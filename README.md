# RNN-for-Time-Series

Recurrent Neural Network Methods for Time Series Forecasting.

This repo contains code and notes on recurrent neural network methods for time series forecasting. The goal is to cover the different aspects of recent developed methods which will be added succesively. Methods are presumably implemented using either AWS SageMaker (either built-in algorithm or in conjunction with another framework) or using the GluonTS API of the Apache MxNet deep learning framework.      
Methods will be applied to the M4Competition dataset. Statistical time series forecasting methods such as the competition's benchmark methods are applied in repo: "M4-Statistical-Methods".
